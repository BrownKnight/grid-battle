          <p>
            Based on the popular Connecting Wall round from the UK BBC game show Only Connect, and similar derivatives such as NYT
            Connections, Grid Battle faces you with a 4x4 grid of words, which can be grouped in to 4 categories.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In Grid Battle, not only can you solve grids and see how you fare on the leaderboard, you can also enter live Battle Rooms to
            compete in real time against your friends.{" "}
            <Link className="text-sky-400 hover:text-sky-600" to="/battle">
              Battle Mode
            </Link>{" "}
            allows you to play any grid, and tracks players scores across rounds to find the overall winner.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-2">How to Play</h2>
          <p>
            When playing grids, you have unlimited attempts to find the 4 categories. Each incorrect attempt results in a 10 second penalty
            to your time. The goal is to solve the grid in the fastest time, including all penalties.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-2">Leaderboards</h2>
          <p>
            The first time you complete a grid (outside of Battle Mode), your time will be saved and entered in to the Leaderboard. To save
            your time to the leaderboard, you must be
            <a href="#" onClick={showLogin} className="ml-1 text-sky-400 hover:text-sky-600">
              logged in.
            </a>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can even
            <Link to="/leaderboards" className="text-sky-400 hover:text-sky-600 mx-1">
              create your own Leaderboard
            </Link>
            to see how your fare you fare against just your friends. Send an invite code or link to anyone and they'll be added to your new
            leaderboard.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-2">Create your own Grid</h2>
          <p>
            You can{" "}
            <Link className="text-sky-400 hover:text-sky-600" to="/grids/create">
              Create your own Grid
            </Link>{" "}
            and have it be played anyone in the community.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When creating your own Grid, it's important to ensure that there is only one correct solution to the grid. Red herrings are a
            popular way to make grids more difficult, however they should still result in a single solution for the whole grid, even if one
            of the categories individually may have multiple solutions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>For example, consider the following two categories:</p>
          <ul className="list-inside list-disc my-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Colours:</strong> Red, Blue, Orange, Green
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Golf Terms:</strong> Putter, Buggy, Fairway, Iron
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The word <em>Green</em> could be considered valid in both categories. However, the other 4 words in the{" "}
            <strong>Golf Terms</strong> category do not cross over with the <strong>Colours</strong> category, which means there is only one
            possible complete solution.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-8 mb-2">Open Source</h2>
